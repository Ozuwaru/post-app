this post app has user management, infinite scrolling and uses AJAX for the data update in the web app, so in 
that way, the whole page is not reloading constantly and all the changes are ocurring in the back of the app.


STEPS TO LOAD THE APP IN YOUR LOCAL PC:

1-Install dependencies like composer and mysql on your computer. 


2- Use an app like xampp to locally run the app.

3-Set all of your enviroment variables on the ENV file, like your databese name, your db ip. the port, etc.

4- On the console opened in the app folder, run "php artisan migrate" to run the database tables.

After all of this i think you should be able to load the page, feel free to contact me for any trouble
or any useful info, upgrades or wathever, have a great day 🍟🏺🎇🎇🎇.

Here is the page hosted, there may be a problem with security, since it's a free host, so don't send any important or real data. <br>
